# SayIt - Anonymous Feedback Application
We at SayIt believe in a positive feedback environment, so we created this anonymous app. In our app, users can provide feedback on certain problems relevant to their current situation while also maintaining their identity. Our feedback system is location-based and will function on a voting system where the user will upload a thought and others will have to upvote or downvote this thought based on accuracy. 


# Distinction
SayIt offers a localized, location-based alternative to global, often impersonal, feedback forums such as that of Reddit.
